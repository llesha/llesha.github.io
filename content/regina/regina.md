title: "ReGIna"
---

is a [dynamically typed](regina/typization) language with [syntax](regina/syntax) similar to
Kotlin and Python.

## Documentation

It is highly recommended to read in following order, don't click on links in articles for the first
time:

1. [syntax](regina/syntax) - language expressions and what they do.
2. [visibility scopes, access priorities](regina/scopes) - how a file is structured.
3. [variable types](regina/types) - all types are listed, their properties, functions and features.
4. [dynamic instantiation](regina/dynamic-instantiation) - core language idea.



## Advantages

* **Can be embedded into web**. Regina is written in Kotlin and compiled into Javascript.
* **Rapid generator development**. Online IDE has an SVG result field to show what each program does.

## Drawbacks

* **It's slow**. It's definitely slower than Python. Yet it's designed to be fast and concise in
  creating generators.
* **There is no community**. At least not yet. Mail me at kononal@gmail.com if you created
  something about Regina.
