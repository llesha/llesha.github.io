      <h1>Eye focus and main eye</h1>
      <p class="meta">
        
        <p>On sketches that illustrate eye focus, it is shown that humans, when looking straight ahead, focus their vision at a point between their eyes. I came to the conclusion that it is not true, and we focus similarly to the picture on the right.</p>
<p>I have a small experimental proof for it. Look in the mirror. What point are you looking at most of the time? For me, it is the right eye. It is the &lsquo;main&rsquo; eye. If you are looking at your eye too, try switching focus to a different eye and keep it there for some time. It might feel weird, and I think that&rsquo;s because you are switching your main eye. If you got acquainted with that feeling, try looking around with a switched main eye. It certainly feels as if you are focusing similarly to the right picture.</p>
