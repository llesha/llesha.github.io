      <description>On sketches that illustrate eye focus, it is shown that humans, when looking straight ahead, focus their vision at a point between their eyes. I came to the conclusion that it is not true, and we focus similarly to the picture on the right.&#xA;I have a small experimental proof for it. Look in the mirror. What point are you looking at most of the time? For me, it is the right eye.</description>
