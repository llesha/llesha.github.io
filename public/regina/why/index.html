<p>TLDR: I didn&rsquo;t think about making a library for dynamic instantiation. I should&rsquo;ve made a library -
that is an optimal path.</p>
<h2 id="birth-of-generator-of-generators">Birth of &lsquo;generator of generators&rsquo;</h2>
<p>I liked creating visual generators. But I didn&rsquo;t like spending 2 weeks to flesh out an idea and to
implement unuseful
tools like deployment to web or geometry functions.</p>
<p><em>Looking back, I realise that I wasted much time due to switching between tools: for plant
generator I used C# and .NET, for House generator I used Godot and for map generator Kotlin with
KorGE (there I spend much time figuring out how to use KorGE and writing my own geometry function)
.</em></p>
<p>I needed a tool to create generators. And I started thinking about it. On this stage, there was no
intention on creating a language, all the more so, I was unqualified at that time. I unofficially
called this tool the &ldquo;generator of generators&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="generator-stages">Generator stages</h2>
<p>I had these project specifications (from most to least priority):</p>
<ol>
<li>It should be possible to create generators of any complexity</li>
<li>It should be concise</li>
<li>Non-programmers should be able to use it</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="web-tool">Web tool</h3>
<p>Geometry primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segment</li>
<li>Rectangle</li>
<li>Polygon/polyline (smooth)</li>
<li>Ellipse</li>
<li>Arc (circle)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Three types of containers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variant</li>
<li>Recursive</li>
<li>Container</li>
</ol>
