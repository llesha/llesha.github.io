      <h1>Why game making is not for me</h1>
      <p class="meta">
        
        <p>TLDR: it is frustrating, initial idea and result have a huge difference, because I associate my
game ideas with emotions, that a player feels during the game. When playing a made game I don&rsquo;t
feel these emotions at all.</p>
<h3 id="game-feel">Game feel</h3>
<p>Game feel is the set of emotions that a person experiences during play session. Game feel is
subjective for everyone. It is <strong>the only thing that defines game value<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-used-to-make-games">How I used to make games</h3>
<p>I came up with a spectacular game idea<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Not long time after, I imagine a default play session,
what
a player should do, <strong>how he would feel</strong>. Right from the start I merge game feel with an idea. And
this is the path to failure.</p>
<p>Thing is, I&rsquo;m a good engineer. I&rsquo;m capable of implementing my game idea. But I also expect that
when playing a resulting game, I would experience expected emotions. And it never happens.
Probably, because it is a job of a game designer.</p>


<h3 id="profession-of-a-game-designer">Profession of a game designer</h3>
<p>I think game designer is responsible for the game feel. It&rsquo;s a whole field, that I know nothing
about. Unlike me, a good game designer can predict what emotions will a player feel during a game.
Or, more importantly, game designer knows, <strong>how</strong> to change an existing product towards a better
game feel.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>To prevent frustration, I shouldn&rsquo;t connect ideas with emotions. If I find an idea to be fun in my
head, I should not expect it to be fun in reality. There are two ways to be better at making fun
games:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn some game design (not game creation)</li>
<li>Iterate, hoping that you are heading towards better game feel. Might not work.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might say: &ldquo;What a bold statement! How about beautiful graphics? Interesting mechanics?
Don&rsquo;t you think that a game with a bad game feel is valuable because of its graphics?&rdquo; No, I don&rsquo;t.
In this case graphics are valuable by themselves. You evaluate graphics from the point of its
visual value. Therefore, if a game has a bad game feel, it&rsquo;s bad as a game, it&rsquo;s not fun to play.
All its parts might be fine but game value is not defined by them in separate, important thing is
<strong>how all pieces together contribute to the emotions that a player feels during the game</strong>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>In this context, I refer to the <strong>game idea</strong> as an interesting original mechanic, raw
gameplay loop, without much detail. I prototype this mechanic, because I think it would be fun to
play.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
